  This is LTL2Rabin, a tool that generates a generalized deterministic rabin automaton from an LTL formula. It is
  released under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>.

  <p>The main class is {@link ltl2rabin.Main}. The class that contains the core functionality, the computation of
      the GDRA, is the {@link ltl2rabin.GDRAFactory} class.

  <p>We distinguish between {@link ltl2rabin.LTL.Formula}, which has limited functionality, and
      {@link ltl2rabin.LTL.PropEquivalenceClass}, which defines the behaviour for propositionally equivalent sets
      of formulas.

  <p>This picture gives an overview over the construction:

  <p>The input is handled by {@link ltl2rabin.Main}. The parsing is handled by an {@link ltl2rabin.LTL.LTLFactory}.
      A {@link ltl2rabin.MojmirAutomaton} is constructed by a {@link ltl2rabin.MojmirAutomatonFactory}.
      A {@link ltl2rabin.SubAutomaton} is constructed by a {@link ltl2rabin.SubAutomatonFromMojmirFactory} or a
      {@link ltl2rabin.SubAutomatonFromFormulaFactory}. The Master Transition System, the product and the
      acceptance conditions are computed by a {@link ltl2rabin.GDRAFactory}.
